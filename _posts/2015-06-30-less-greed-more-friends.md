Let's present ourselves: We are a new group willing to deliver games that do **make you feel good**. *No guilt, no regret*. :)

We will do our best to help you improve your **skills** and bring you **closer to your family and friends**.

Games are fun but games are a business, that's for sure. What we fail to see is how you need to use behavioral theories and compulsive loops to make people play your game. We mean, *shouldn't it be attractive by itself?*

## We can do better

*We can do better*. We bet all this industry can do better. And it is heading there; we're not doing this alone, we're simply **making it our principle**.

So, let us present you what you'll receive from us:

- Memorable experiences.
- Better moments with your family, friends and society.
- Brain and skill challenges.
- Expect to see *some connections* between our games. Keep your eyes open.

One last thing: we work for you, so we do wanna listen. Our social channels are open. We make it better together (there is truth in that clich√© sentence).

[Support us on Patreon](//www.patreon.com/{{ site.patreon_username }})! Your help will be wisely used; no company can sustain itself in the long run with deceit and irresponsibility.

Thank you for reading, and have a great week. :)
