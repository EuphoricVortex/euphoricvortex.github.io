hints:
  - Deliver to customers simultaneously. Don't focus on only one client.
  - The monsters in a single order don't have to be delivered in sequence.
  - If the clients give you a rest, focus on distributing the monsters around to access them easily.
  - Difficulty increases with time, so finishing orders quickly at the beginning guarantees that more (easy) customers will show before the game gets harder. You will also get more free time to do the previous point.
cheats:
  - We have not added any cheats yet.
  - Yes, we will add cheats, but nothing that makes the game unfair to non-cheaters.
