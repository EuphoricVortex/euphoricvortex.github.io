hints:
  - Deliver to customers simultaneously. Don't focus on only one client.
  - The monsters of a single order don't have to be delivered in sequence.
  - If the clients give you a rest, focus on distributing the monsters around to access them easily.
  - Difficulty increases with time, so finishing orders quickly at the beginning guarantees that more (easy) customers will show before the game gets harder. You will also get more free time to do the previous point.
  - In multiplayer, efficient communication between the two players really makes things easier. Don't just build monsters randomly, and try to organize yourselves.
cheats:
  - We have not added any cheats yet.
  - Yes, we will add cheats, but nothing that makes the game unfair to non-cheaters.

    events:
      - Multiplayer mode successfully works in mobile and is disabled in web.
      - Made the Leaderboard screen show the friends' profile pictures.
      - A workaround was made so the internet connection is better detected, allowing offline play to work as expected (it crashed before). We tried fixing this issue directly instead of using a workaround and, after 5 weeks of 100% time into the subject, we failed.
