hints:
  - Deliver to customers simultaneously. Don't focus on only one client.
  - The monsters of a single order don't have to be delivered in sequence.
  - Try to count how many monsters of a single color are in each customer to deliver them faster.
  - If the clients give you a rest, focus on distributing the monsters around to access them easily.
  - Difficulty increases with time, so finishing orders quickly at the beginning guarantees that more (easy) customers will show before the game gets harder. You will also get more free time to do the previous point.
  - In multiplayer, efficient communication between the two players really makes things easier. Don't just build monsters randomly, and try to organize yourselves.
cheats:
  - We have not added any cheats yet.
  - Yes, we will add cheats, but nothing that makes the game unfair to non-cheaters.

      - Launched the game worldwide.
  -
    date: 2016-03-11
    events:
      - The first tutorial of the game is now shorter.
      - We added new tutorials to show each special monster you unlock.
      - Now levels have names. Your progress through levels now gives you ranks.
      - The objectives were modified to reach each level and we added a different set of objectives for mobile.
      - Difficulty was increased again, especially for mobile.
      - The effects of the special monsters are more attractive with new animations and sounds.
      - "A \"crowd\" animation appears behind the clients that grows bigger as time passes by."
      - The pause button was changed.
      - We heavily modified the game over screen. It is now way more engaging and clear.
      - Before, when you lost a match, you would lose every monster you bought. Now you will recover any monster that didn't show up. You will still lose any monster that appears and you voluntarily leave hanging around.
      - Other minor fixes.

    date: 2016-02-19
    events:
      - "Two special clients were added: a wealthy client and a thief."
      - We modified the initial game tutorial, both for single and multiplayer.
      - The difficulty was substantially increased, both for PCs and mobile devices.
      - "\"Losing a life\" is now more evident in-game."
      - A "reset" button was added in the Play Configuration screen.
      - The game wouldn't work for PCs and devices without local cache. Now it works (although it obviously doesn't save progress locally).

      - The store was added with Facebook payments (although mobile payments have not been optimized yet) and group purchases.
      - The monsters' animations were improved to make them crush when squeezed.

    events:
      - Multiplayer mode successfully works in mobile and is disabled in web.
      - Made the Leaderboard screen show the friends' profile pictures.
      - A workaround was made so the internet connection is better detected, allowing offline play to work as expected (it crashed before). We tried fixing this issue directly instead of using a workaround and, after 5 weeks of 100% time into the subject, we failed.
